\begin{abstract}
Previously 1-year global magnetohydrodynamics simulation was made using the GUMICS$-$4 code and the OMNI 1-min resolution solar wind data from January 29, 2002 to February 2, 2003 as input. Along the orbit of the Cluster SC3 reference spacecraft the simulation data was saved. We compare the saved parameters to the Cluster SC3 measurements. We use the magnetic field Z component, the solar wind velocity X component and the solar wind density of the Cluster magnetometer, ion plasma and spacecraft potential measurements geocentric solar ecliptic reference frame. We select intervals in the solar wind, the magnetosheath and the magnetosphere where the instruments above provided good quality data and the spacecraft and the simulation are in the same region. We determine the location of the bow shock, the magnetopause and the neutral sheet in the spacecraft measurements and compare their position in the observation and simulations.

The GUMICS$-$4 provides quite good results in the solar wind. Its accuracy is significantly worse in the magnetosheath. The simulation results are not realistic in the magnetosphere. The bow shock location is predicted well however the magnetopause location is less accurate. The neutral sheet positions are located quite well thank to the special solar wind conditions. The reason of these inaccuracies is the missing inner magnetosphere model and the obsolete algorithms applied in the code.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The most cost-effective way to study the interaction of the solar wind and the planetary magnetospheres (or predict the conditions of the near-Earth space) is using a global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code(s). Robust parallelized, effective, verified and validated codes were developed, are used and applied for forecasting the cosmic environment of the Earth; such as the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry, LFM \citep{lyon04:_lyon_fedder_mobar_lfm_mhd} code, the Open Geospace General Circulation Model, OpenGGCM \citep{raeder08:_openg_simul_themis_mission}, the Block-Adaptive-Tree-Solarwind-Roe-Upwind-Scheme, BATS-R-US \citep{powell99:_solut_adapt_upwin_schem_ideal_magnet,toth12:_adapt}. In Europe only three global MHD code were developed: the Grand Unified Magnetosphere--Ionosphere Coupling Simulation \citep[GUMICS$-$4;][]{janhunen12:_gumic_mhd}, the COOLFluiD \citep{lani12:_coolf_open_comput_platf_aerot} and the GORGON 3D magnetohydrodynamic code. The COOLFluiD is a general-purpose plasma simulation tool. The Gorgon code was developed for studying high energy, collisional plasmainteractions and has been adapted to simulate planetary magnetospheres and their interaction with the solar wind \citep{mejnertsen16:_global_mhd_neptun,mejnertsen18:_global_mhd_simul_earth_bow}. The GUMICS$-$4 was developed to study the solar wind-terrestrial magnetosphere interaction and has not been parallelized (see Section~\ref{sec:gumics}). These codes are available at the Community Coordinated Modelling Center (CCMC; http://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/) hosted by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). The comparison of the simulation results to spacecraft and ground-based measurements is necessary to understand the abilities and features of the developed tools. The statistical study using long term global MHD runs for validation and verification of the codes seems to be a good and fruitful method. However, providing long simulations is costly and time consuming hence only a few study had done previously using much shorter simulations than a year. 

\citet{guild08:_geotail_lfm1,guild08:_geotail_lfm2} launched two months of LFM run and compared the plasma sheets properties in the simulated tail to the statistical properties of six years Geotail magnetic field and plasma observations \citep{kokubun94:_geotail_magnet_field_exper,mukai94:_low_energ_partic_lep_exper_geotail_satel}. The LFM successfully reproduced the global features of the global plasma sheet in statistical sense. However, there were some differences. The sheet was too cold, too dense and the bulk flow was faster than the observed plasma sheet. The LFM overestimated the ionospheric transpolar potential. The transpolar potential correlated with the speed of the plasma sheet flows. The equatorial maps of density, thermal pressure, thermal energy and velocity was compared. The LFM overestimated the plasma sheet density close to the Earth and underestimates the temperature by a factor of $\sim$3. The LFM overestimated the global average flow speed by a factor of $\sim$2. The LFM reproduced many of the climatological features of the Geotail data set. The low-resolution model underestimated the occurrence of the fast earthward and tailward flows. Increasing the simulation resolution resulted the development of fast, busty flows. These flows contributed the statistics and brought closer the simulations to the observations.

\citet{zhang11:_lyon_fedder_mobar_mhd} launched two months long LFM simulation to study the statistics of magnetosphere-ionosphere (MI) coupling. The LFM simulation was also used in the previous study of \citet{guild08:_geotail_lfm1}. The polar cap potential and the field aligned currents (FAC), the downward Poynting flux and the vorticity of the ionospheric convection were compared with observed statistical averages and the Weimer05 empirical model \citep{weimer05:_improv_joule}. The comparisons showed that the LFM model produces quite accurate average distributions of the Region 1 (R1) and Region 2 (R2) currents. The ionospheric Region 2 currents in the MHD simulation seemed to be originated from the diamagnetic ring current. The average LFM Region 1 and 2 currents were smaller compared with the values from the Weimer05 model. The average CPCP was higher in the LFM simulation than the measurements of the SuperDARN and the Weimer05 model. The average convention pattern was quite symmetric in the LFM simulation against the SuperDARN measurements and the Weimer05 model. The SuperDARN measurements and the Weimer05 model had dawn-dusk asymmetry. In the LFM, model more Poyting flux flows into the polar region ionosphere than in the Weimer05 model. This was the consequence of the larger CPCP in the LFM simulation. The larger CPCP allowed higher electric field in the polar region. The statistical dependence of the high-latitude convection patterns on Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) clock angle was similar to the SuperDARN measurements \citep{sofko95:_direc_super} and the Weimer05 model. The average ionospheric field-aligned vorticity showed good agreement on the dayside. However, the LFM model gave larger nightside vorticity than SuperDARN measurements because the Pedersen conductance on the night side ionosphere was too low. 

\citet{wiltberger17:_struc_high_latit_curren_magnet_ionos_model} studied the structure of the high latitude field-aligned current patterns using three resolutions of the LFM global MHD code and the Weimer05 empirical model \citep{weimer05:_improv_joule}. The studied period was a month long and contained two high-speed streams. Generally, the patterns agreed well with results obtained from the Weiner05 computing. As the resolution of the simulations increased, the currents became more intense and narrow. The ratio of the Region 1 (R1), the Region 2 (R2) currents and the R1/R2 ratio increased when the simulation resolution increases. However, both the R1 and R2 currents were smaller than the predictions of the Weimer05 model. This effect led better agreement of the LFM simulation results to the Weimer~2005 model results. The CPCP pattern became concentrated in higher latitudes because of the stronger R2 currents. The relationship of the CPCP and the R1 looks evident at higher resolution of the simulation. The LFM simulation could have reproduced the statistical features of the field aligned current (FAC) patterns. 

\citet{haiducek17:_swmf_global_magnet_simul_januar} simulated a month of January 2005 using the Space Weather Modelling Framework \citep[SWMF;][]{toth05:_space_weath_model_framew} and the OMNI solar wind data as input. The simulations were done with and without inner magnetosphere model and using two different grid resolutions. The model was very good in predicting the currents circling the Earth around the dipole axis \citep[SYM-H; http://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/aeasy/asy.pdf;][]{iyemori90:_storm}. The $K_p$ index (that measures the general magnetospheric convention and the auroral currents \citep{bartels39,rostoker72:_geomag,thomsen04:_why_kp}) was predicted well during storms however the index was over predicted during quiet time periods. The AL index (that describe the westward electrojet on the surface magnetic field introduced by \citet{davis66:_auror_ae}) was predicted reasonably well in average however the model reached the highest negative AL value less often than the observations because the model captured poorly the structure of the auroral zone currents. The overpredicting of $K_p$ index during quiet times might have had the same reason because that index was also sensitive for the auroral zone dynamics. The SWMF usually over predicted the CPCP. These results were not sensitive to grid resolutions. Except that the AL index reached more often the highest negative value when the grid resolution was higher. Switching off of the inner magnetosphere model had dramatic effect for the accuracy of all quantities mentioned above, except the CPCP. 

In this paper the Cluster SC3 measurements are compared directly to a previously made 1-year long GUMICS$-$4 simulation in the solar wind, magnetosheath and the magnetosphere along the Cluster SC3 orbit saved from the simulation results and measured by the spacecraft. Three parameters ($B_z$, $V_X$ and $n$) were studied and the location of the bow shock, magnetopause and the neutral sheet. The structure of this paper is as follows. Section~\ref{sec:data} describes the GUMICS$-$4 code, the 1-year simulation and the instruments. Section~\ref{sec:comp} gives comparisons between the simulations and observations. Results of the comparison are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:discussion}. Finally, Section~\ref{sec:concl} contains the conclusions.

\section{The GUMICS$-$4 product and Cluster measurements}
\label{sec:data}

Here we use two types of very different and difficult time series. The first type is derived from previously made 1-year GUMICS$-$4 simulation \citep{facsko16:_one_earth}. The second type was measured by the magnetometer, ion plasma and electric field instruments of the Cluster reference spacecraft.

\subsection{The GUMICS$-$4 code}
\label{sec:gumics}

The GUMICS$-$4 has two coupled simulation domains, the magnetospheric domain outside of 3.7\,$R_E$ radius around the Earth and a coupled ionosphere module containing a 3D electron density model if the ionosphere. The GUMICS$-$4 is not parallel code however the code was extensively used for studying the energy propagation processes from the solar wind to the magnetosphere through the magnetopause and other features \citep[][see the references therein]{janhunen12:_gumic_mhd}. The code had also been applied for study the forced reconnection in the tail \citep{voeroes14:_winds_condit_ram_co_ram}. Recently a few hundred of synthetic two hours duration GUMICS$-$4 simulations was made to compare the simulation results to empirical formulas \citep{gordeev13:_verif_gumic_mhd}. The agreement was quite good however; the diameter of the magnetopause deviated significantly in the simulation and the observations in the tail. The tail of the GUMICS$-$4 was smaller than spacecraft observed and measured. 1-year long simulation was made using the GUMICS$-$4 code \citep{facsko16:_one_earth}. \citet{juusola14:_statis_gumic_mhd} compared the ionospheric currents, fields and the cross polar cap potential (CPCP) in the simulation versus Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) radars \citep{greenwald95:_darn_super} and CHAMP spacecraft \citep{reigber02:_champ} field aligned currents (FAC) measurements \citep{juusola07:_hall_peder_champ,ritter04:_ionos_champ_image}. The agreement was good the seasonal variation of the CPCP however the FAC and other currents could not be reproduced properly. The possible reason of this bad agreement could be the leak of the inner magnetosphere model. This statement is supported by the result of \citet{haiducek17:_swmf_global_magnet_simul_januar}. \citeauthor{haiducek17:_swmf_global_magnet_simul_januar} simulated only a month using different spatial resolution and to test the codes switched off the inner magnetosphere model of the SWMF for a special run.  This run without inner magnetosphere model resulted that only the CPCP parameter of the simulation agreed quite well with the measurement. This fact explains why was so good the agreement between the Cluster SC3 and the GUMICS$-$4 simulations and gave sense to provide the studies of \citet{lakka18:_cross_polar_cap_satur_gumic,lakka18:_icme_earth_mach} based on the CPCP in GUMICS$-$4 simulations. \citet{kallio15:_proper} determined the solar wind parameters along the Moon orbit using the results of the \citet{facsko16:_one_earth}'s global MHD simulations. The solar wind parameters differ significantly in the geotail that should be considered in future studies of the interaction of the solar wind and the lunar orbit. \citet{facsko16:_one_earth} determined the footprint the Cluster SC3 using the 1-year simulation and the Tsyganenko T96 empirical model \citep{tsyganenko95:_model_earth}. The code seems to be react slower for the dynamic changes of the solar wind pressure than the empirical model. The agreement of the footprint is better in the Northern Hemisphere. The GUMICS$-$4 tail looks shorter in the simulation than the observations. Finally, the Y component of the interplanetary magnetic field twists the simulated tail hence the agreement of the empirical and computational footprints worse at such solar wind conditions.

A workpackage of the European Cluster Assimilation Technology (ECLAT) project (https://cordis.europa.eu/result/rcn/165813\_en.html; http://www.eclat--project.eu/) was the creation and analysis of 1-year global MHD simulation using the OMNI solar wind data  from January 29, 2002 to February 2, 2003 as input of the GUMICS$-$4 code \citep{facsko16:_one_earth}. The GUMICS-4 is a single core system \citep{janhunen12:_gumic_mhd} hence the 1-year simulation was made in 1860 independent runs. This interval covers 155 Cluster SC3 orbit lasting 57 hours. The supercomputer had 12 CPUs on each node hence the 57 hours were divided into 4.7 hours simulation time with one hour initialisation period. Each sub-intervals used its own average Geocentric Solar Ecliptic (GSE) IMF magnetic field X component $B_x$ component and dipole tilt angle. All data gaps of the input file were filled using interpolation. If the data gap of the input file was at the beginning (or the end) interval the first (or last) good data of the input file was used to fill the gap. The initialisation of each simulations was made using constant values. These values were the first valid data of the input file repeated 60 times (60 minutes) in the input file of the sub-interval. The simulation results were saved in every five minutes. Various simulation parameters, for example, the density, particle density, temperature, magnetic field, solar wind velocity (29 different quantities) are saved from the simulation results along the Cluster reference spacecraft in the GSE coordinates. In this paper these parameters, namely the $B_z$ magnetic field GSE Z component, the solar wind velocity GSE X component ($V_x$) and the solar wind density $n$ are compared to the Cluster SC3 measurement. These parameters were selected because the $B_z$ controls the magnetosphere, the $V_x$ is the main solar wind velocity component and the $n$ is the ion plasma momentum that is the easiest to calculate; furthermore more instruments could determine it (see Section~\ref{sec:cluster}).

\subsection{The Cluster SC3 measurements}
\label{sec:cluster}

The Cluster-II spacecraft of the European Space Agency (ESA) were launched in 2000 and study the geospace since then \citep{credland97:_clust_mission,escoubet01:_introd_clust}. Its four spacecraft form a tetrahendron however here we use only the measurements of the reference spacecraft, the Cluster SC3. The spacecraft are stabilised by rotation and its period is $\sim$4\,s. Hence, the temporal resolution of the plasma instruments are considered 4\,s and we use 4\,s averaged magnetic field data. The real resolution of the Cluster FluxGate Magnetometer (FGM) magnetic field instrument is 27\,Hz \citep{balogh97:_clust_magnet_field_inves,balogh01:_clust_magnet_field_inves}. The ion plasma data is provided by the Cluster Ion Spectrometry (CIS) Hot Ion Analyser (HIA) sub-instrument \citep{reme97:_clust_ion_spect_exper,reme01:_first_earth_clust_cis}. The CIS HIA instrument is calibrated using the Waves of HIgh frequency Sounder for Probing the Electron density by Relaxation (WHISPER) wave instrument onboard Cluster \citep{decreau01:_early_whisp_clust,trotignon10:_whisp_relax_sound_clust_activ_archiv,blagau13:_in_hot_ion_analy_clust,blagau14:_in_hot_ion_analy_clust}. These calibrations might appear as sudden non-physical jumps in the CIS HIA data. The CIS HIA has different modes to measure in the solar wind and the magnetosphere. When the instrument switches from a mode to another mode it appears as a non-physical jump in the measured data too. These features has influence for the accuracy of the data analysis.

We protected our results from these non-physical jumps described previously using a density determination based on different principles. We used the spacecraft potential of the Electric Field and Wave Experiment \citep[EFW ;][]{gustafsson97:_elect_field_wave_exper_clust_mission,gustafsson01:_first_clust_efw} to determine the electron density. This quantity can be calculated using the empirical density formula 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:empdens}
n_{EFW}=200(V_{sc})^{-1.85},
\end{equation}
where $n_{EFW}$ is the calculated density and $V_{sc}$ is the Cluster EFW spacecraft potential \citep{trotignon10:_whisp_relax_sound_clust_activ_archiv,trotignon11:_calib_repor_whisp_measur_clust}. The EFW and the WHISPER are used for the calibration of the CIS HIA and the Plasma Electron and Current Experiment \citep[PEACE;][]{johnstone97:_peace,fazakerley10:_peace_data_clust_activ_archiv,fazakerley10:_clust_peace_in_calib_status}. Both instruments still working onboard all Cluster spacecraft. Their stabile operation reduces the number of data gaps; furthermore makes easier the data analysis.

\section{Comparison of measurements to simulation}
\label{sec:comp}

The saved parameters from the GUMICS$-$4 simulations and the Cluster SC3 magnetic field, solar wind velocity and density measurements are compared in the solar wind, magnetosheath and magnetosphere using cross correlation calculation. The resolution of the simulated Cluster orbit data is mostly five minutes because the simulations are saved in every five minutes \citep{facsko16:_one_earth}. However, the time difference between points could be more than five minutes at the boundary of the subintervals, because the length of simulation intervals is determined in minutes. To facilitate analysis of the simulation results, all simulation data were interpolated to one minute resolution. This method does not provide extra information to the cross correlation calculation. The data gaps are eliminated using interpolation in the data and extrapolation when the gap is at the start or the end of the selected interval. The spin resolution (4\,s) of Cluster SC3 magnetic field measurements is averaged over one minute around ($\pm30\,s$) the time stamps of the saved data. 

For the correlation calculation intervals are selected carefully in the solar wind, the magnetosheath, the dayside and the night side magnetosphere. In these intervals the parameters do not varied a lot and neither the Cluster nor the virtual probe crossed any boundary layer. To compare the shape of the $B_z$ magnetic field, $V_x$ solar wind speed and the $n_{CIS}$ and the $n_{EFW}$ curves we calculate cross correlation on selected intervals. Sometimes we get very bad results. Then we examined carefully the case and removed the short intervals (shorter than four hours) from the correlation calculation and large data gaps from the correlation calculation. (The data gaps are interpolated however they cause loss of information.) Those intervals are also neglected where the plasma instrument has calibration error or changed its mode from magnetosphere to solar wind (for example). The electron density is also calculated using the empirical density formula (see Equation~\ref{eq:empdens}) and make the correlation calculation. We want to avoid calibration errors and sudden non-physical jumps mentioned previously. The results do not differ significantly however the $n_{EFW}$ has not mode change and it is applicable in the magnetosphere too (against the CIS HIA instrument).

\subsection{Solar wind}
\label{sec:sw}

We use IMF and solar wind velocity, density and temperature data as input of the simulation. However, it is not useless to compare the solar wind region in the simulation and the measurements. The IMF X component cannot be given to the GUMICS$-$4 as input \citep{janhunen12:_gumic_mhd,facsko16:_one_earth}. However the magnetic field of the solar wind has X component in the simulations. Additionally the solar wind structure might change from the simulation domain boundary at +32\,$R_E$ to the sub-solar point of the terrestrial bow shock where all OMNI data is shifted. Almost the same solar wind intervals are used as in the see Table~1 of \citet{facsko16:_one_earth}. The number of these intervals is small because the Cluster fleet instruments were calibrated in 2002, just after launching (Table~\ref{tab:sw}). Hence we do not have so good ion plasma data coverage for this year. Additionally, to improve the accuracy of the correlation calculation (see below) we delete those intervals which were too short (shorter than five hours) or the CIS HIA instrument changed its mode. The Cluster fleet is located in the solar wind only from December to May and only for a couple of hours during each orbit near to the apogee. We double check whether the Cluster SC3 stays in the solar wind in both the simulation and the reality. We also check the omnidirectional CIS HIA ion spectra on the Cluster Science Archive (CSA; https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/csa/csds-quicklook-plots). Hence 17 intervals are remained in the solar wind to study (Figure~\ref{fig:sworbit}). 

The selected intervals have quiet solar wind conditions (Figure~\ref{fig:swomni}). The GUMICS$-$4 simulation results have five minutes resolution and the Cluster SC3 measurements have one minutes resolution (Figure~\ref{fig:swplot}). The measurements vary significantly. Inspect of the quiet conditions the solar wind density often changes and deviates from the simulation. On the left of the Figure~\ref{fig:swscatplot} both densities deviate significantly. The CIS HIA density deviation is larger as it is expected because of the complexity and the large number of working modes of the CIS instrument. The magnetic field and the solar wind velocity fit better. On the left side of the Figure~\ref{fig:swcorrplot} the correlation of the magnetic field is very good; furthermore the correlation of the solar wind velocity and density is excellent (Table~\ref{tab:sw}). The time shift on the right side of the Figure~\ref{fig:swcorrplot} is about five minutes for the magnetic field and the CIS data. For the EFW data the time shift is worse. It is not determined as well as the other parameters.

\subsection{Magnetosheath}
\label{sec:msh}

The Cluster SC3 spent only a few time in the solar wind from December, 2002 to May, 2003. However the orbit of the spacecraft always crosses the magnetosheath (Figure~\ref{fig:mshorbit}). We selected intervals when the value of the magnetic field is around 25\,nT. The field should be fluctuating because of the turbulent and deviated flow of the solar wind after passing the bow shock. In the same time the solar wind temperature increases. The solar wind speed drops it value is only 100-300\,km/s. The density of the plasma flow increaes and reached the 10-20\,cm\textsuperscript{-3}.  The narrow band on the  omnidirectional CIS HIA ion spectra from the CSA (https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/csa/csds-quicklook-plots) is widened after passing the bow shock. After 15-30 \,min this passage we considered the Cluster SC3 to be entered to the magnetosheath. At the inner boundary the flow speed drops and the density as well. The magnetic field starts growing and it is less turbulent than in the magnetosheath. The wide band on the  the omnidirectional CIS HIA ion spectra disappears. 15-30 minutes before the appearance  of these indicators of the magnetopause crossing our intervals end. All intervals contain large data gap, non-physical jump of instrument mode changing or shorter than four hour are removed. Hence 74 intervals considered in our final selection (Table~\ref{tab:msh}). 

All intervals have quiet upstream (or input) solar wind conditions (Figure~\ref{fig:mshomni}). Inspect of our selection the magnetic field and the plasma parameters and the calculated empirical density varies significantly stronger than in the solar wind intervals (Figure~\ref{fig:mshplot}). The deviation of the simulated and the observed data is larger in this region as well. The scattered plots of the magnetic field, plasma flow speed and the densities agree well however these plot relatively less accurate than the scattered plots of the solar wind (Figure~\ref{fig:mshscatplot}). The correlation of the simulated and the observed data is good for the magnetic field, very good for the ion plasma moments and the calculated density (Figure~\ref{fig:mshcorrplot}, left). The timeshift of the magnetic field is within five minutes mostly however the timeshift of the ion plasma moments is scattered. The timeshift of the calculated EFW density seems to be more accurate. Generally, the GUMICS$-$4 is less accurate in the magnetosheath. The magnetic field is quite good however the plasma parameters are not so good. The calculated empirical EFW density ($n_{EFW}$) fits better than the CIS HIA density ($n_{CIS}$).


\subsection{Magnetosphere}
\label{sec:msph}

To select intervals in the magnetosphere we looked for the CIS HIA OMNI directional ionflux. When the band of the hot magnetosheath ion population (dis)apperared, the magnetosphere started/finished. The solar wind density becomes slowly zero, a magnetic field and the solar wind density drop and reached the zero values. We left 15-30\,min after/before the magnetopause transition to appoint the interval in the magnetopshere. In this way we found 132 intervals in the magnetosphere (Table~\ref{tab:msph}) using Cluster SC3 measurements. The Cluster SC3 spends considerable time in the magnetosphere (Figure~\ref{fig:msphorbit}). 

Here we show neither any correlation calculation nor comparison plot here. In the magnetosphere the GUMICS$-$4 does not work well. Neither the magnetic field nor the plasma moments nor the $N_{EFW}$ fit well. The solar wind velocity does not reach zero in the simulation. Instead the solar wind enters to the night side magnetosphere. The solar wind CIS HIA ion plasma density and the calculated density from spacecraft potential increase closer to the Earth (plasmasphere). The GUMICS$-$4 density is low there. We calculated the dipole field in GSE using Tsyganenko geotool box \citep{tsyganenko95:_model_earth} and subtracked from both the observed and the simulated magnetic field $B_z$ data. The correlation of these corrected magnetic field measurements and simulations is very low too. 

\subsection{Bow shock, magnetopause, neutral sheet}
\label{sec:bs}

78 intervals are selected when the Cluster SC3 crossed the terrestial bow shock once or multiple times. When the spacecraft crosses the bow shock inward direction the magnitude of the magnetic field and the solar wind density increases 4-5 times (from 5\,nT or 5\,$cm^{-3}$, respectively), the solar wind speed drops from 400--600\,km/s to 100--300\,km/s; furthermore the narrow band on the omnidirectional Cluster CIS HIA ion spectra is widened. The Cluster measurements are 1-min averaged and the GUMICS$-$4 simulations has 5-min resolution hence all bow shock transitions of the virtual spacecraft are slower and smoother. Additionaly, the multiple bow shock transitions are not visible in the GUMICS simulations. The code reacts slowly for such sudden changes. The magnetic signatures fit better than the calculated plasma moments. The jump of the ion plasma parameters and the derived Cluster EFW density of the simulations are shifted to the measurements. Generally, the density and the velocity of the simulations seem to be less accurate than the magnetic field of the simulations.

56 intervals are selected around magnetopause crossings (Anekallu, private communication). When the spacecraft crosses the magnetopause inward direction the magnitude of the magnetic field increases, the solar wind speed drops from 100--300\,km/s to zero, the plasma density becomes zero; furthermore the wide band on the omnidirectional Cluster CIS HIA ion spectra disappears. These changes are not so fast. The location of the magnetopause is well determined by the Cluster SC3 measurements. However, it is very difficult to identify the magnetopause crossings in the simulation data. The 5-min resolution of the simulations provides smooth and averaged curves without sharp changes. Furthermore, the magnetopause crossings very often cannot be seen in the simulations. Or when the magnetopause crossings are clearly identifed in both simulations and spacecraft measurements the events are shifted. The accuracy of the model is lower for the dayside magnetopause locations. 

Nine intervals are chosen around Cluster SC3 neutral sheet crossings (Figure~\ref{fig:nsorbit}; Table~\ref{tab:ns}; Tanskanen, private communication). The neutral sheets location is determined using the results of the Boundary Layet Identification Code (BLIC) Project \citep{facskoon:_bow_clust}. The BLIC code determines the neutral sheet crossing Cluster FGM magnetic field measurements using \citet{wang94:_signat}'s method. When the solar wind speed is almost zero; furthermore the CIS HIA density and the EFW calculated density are almost zero too; finally the GSE Z component of the magntic field changes its sign the code indicated neutral sheet crossing (Figure~\ref{fig:nsplot}; red and blue curves). Surprisingly the neutral sheet crossings are visible very well in the GUMICS simulations (Figure~\ref{fig:nsplot}; black curves). For five events (from nine Cluster SC3 crossings) the GUMICS$-$4 also provides similar smoothed parameters and change of sign of the $B_{z}$ component. This is a very good result because the tail in the GUMICS$-$4 simulations is significantly smaller than the observed \citep{gordeev13:_verif_gumic_mhd,facsko16:_one_earth}; furthermore the solar wind enters in the tail in MHD simulations generaly \citep{kallio15:_proper}.


\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

The agreement of the solar wind $B_{z}$, $V_{x}$ and $n_{EFW}$ with the similar GUMICS simulation parameters is very good (Figure~\ref{fig:swscatplot}). The agreement of the $n_{CIS}$ is worse. It was expected because the $N_{EFW}$ depends only the spacecraft potential provied by the EFW instrument. However, the CIS instument has many mode for measure the plasma parameters and it needs periodical claibration too. The correlation of the solar wind $V_{x}$,  $n_{CIS}$ and $n_{EFW}$ with the similar GUMICS simulation parameters is greater then 0.9 (Figure~\ref{fig:swcorrplot}). The correlation of the $B_{z}$ is greater than 0.8. Both numbers prove very high correlation. The inbound wall of the GUMICS$-$4 code is at $32\,R_E$ \citep{janhunen12:_gumic_mhd}, the nose of the terrestrial bow shock is at around $20\,R_E$. If the solar wind speed is 400\,km/s, then this spatial distance means less than 5\,minutes delay, so it should not be visible. 80\% of the intervals support this theory but 20\,\% not. In these cases the one-minute resolution $B_z$, $n_{CIS}$ or the $n_{EFW}$ parameters have a sudden jump or variation that the simulation cannot follow, or the resolution of the simulation data (5\,minutes) is too small to see these variations. Therefore, the correlation calculation is not accurate in these cases. Previously the OMNIWeb data was compared to the Cluster data and the Cluster measurements were compared to the GUMICS$-$4 \citep{facsko16:_one_earth}. The comparison suggests that the GUMICS$-$4 results should be similar with the OMNIWeb data. Furthermore, we calculate correlation functions in the solar wind, where there is no significant perturbation of the input parameters in the simulation box. Therefore, we got an expected result after comparing the two different correlation calculations.

In the magnetosheath we get worse agreement with the GUMICS simulation data (Figure~\ref{fig:mshscatplot}). However, it means only the larger uncertainty of the scattered plot. The general reason of this larger uncertainty seems to the larger number of point. The slowed down solar wind shows strong turbulence. This fenomena explains the higher variations of the $B_{z}$ magnetic field. The solar wind $V_{x}$, $n_{CIS}$ and $n_{EFW}$ agree better than the magnetic field component. Here there is no deviation between the densities dervied in differents ways ($n_{CIS}$ and $n_{EFW}$). The Figure~\ref{fig:mshcorrplot} seems to be contradict these statements above. The larger uncertainty of the $B_{z}$ is visible on the top left corner of the Figure~\ref{fig:mshcorrplot}. However, that correlation is still good. The other parameters have larger ($>0.9$) correlation. However, the time shifts on the right side of the Figure~\ref{fig:mshcorrplot} seem to be workse. Actually here the time shift are worse because the shape of the time series in the magnetosheath looks very similar. Hence, the correlation calculation provides larger time shifts for the ion plasma parameters and the $n_{EFW}$. 

In the magnetosphere the GUMICS$-$4 does not work well. The GUMICS$-$4 uses a tilted dipole to describe the terrestrial magnetic field \citep{janhunen12:_gumic_mhd}. After removing the magnetic dipole from the magnetic filed measurements of the Cluster SC3 and the simulation we get very low correlations and unacceptable time shifts (not shown). In the inner magnetosphere the tilted dipole is an unsufficient description. However, the plasma momentums and the $N_{EFW}$ fit neither. The MHD approach lost its validity in the inner magnetosphere domain therefore the $V_{x}$ and the $n$ of the simulations do not agree to the $V_{x}$, the $n_{CIS}$ and the $n_{EFW}$ measeured by the Cluster SC3. Within the $3.7\,R_{E}$ domain another model is necessary that contains more physics as you can see another global MHD code \citep{lyon04:_lyon_fedder_mobar_lfm_mhd,raeder08:_openg_simul_themis_mission,powell99:_solut_adapt_upwin_schem_ideal_magnet,toth12:_adapt}. This result explains the limited accuracy of the cross polar cap potentical (CPCP) and  geomagnetic indices of the GUMICS simulations \citep{juusola14:_statis_gumic_mhd}. The CPCP had good agreement of GUMICS simulations and spacecraft measurements therefore this quantity could be used for capable and relevant simulation studies \citep{lakka18:_cross_polar_cap_satur_gumic}. \citet{haiducek17:_swmf_global_magnet_simul_januar} also made a comparison study of the geomagnetic indices and the CPCP. The Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF) was tested. When the inner magnetosphere model was swithed off in the simulation the only the comparison of the simulated and observed CPCP was good. Therefore, the reason of the discrepancy of the geomagnetic indices in the GUMICS simulations must be the missing inner magnetosphere model.

% Badness of the correlation vs. OMNI in the SW and the MSH.

You suggested to check whether the wrong GUMICS-4 simulation results depend on the solar wind parameters (Bx, By, Bz, Vx, Vy, Vz, p). I saved the averaged shifted OMNI parameters. I added manually when the correlation of the Bz, Vx, nCIS and nEFW is wrong. I plotted the distribution of the OMNI parameters belong to the bad simulation results for the solar wind region and in the magnetosheath. I did not make the study for the magnetosphere because the deviance is so large that cannot be explained in this way. The brief result for the solar wind and magnetosheath regions is that the badness of the GUMICS-4 simulations does not depend on the OMNI parameters.

% --------------------

The bow shock locations agree in the GUMICS simulations and the Cluster SC3 measurements. However, the magnetopause locations does not fit as good as the bow shock in simulations and observations. In simulations the location of the magnetopause are determined by currents densities or particle density gradients \citep[][see references therein]{garcia07:_findin_lyon_fedder_mobar,gordeev13:_verif_gumic_mhd}. In this paper the previously saved simulation parameters along the virtual Cluster SC3 orbit are analyzed. Therefore, the above mentioned methods cannot be applied. The reason of the inaccuraty of the magnetopause positions in the simulations must be the missing inner magnetosphere and ring current module. This discrepancy of the magnetopause location agrees with the results of \citet{gordeev13:_verif_gumic_mhd} and \citet{facsko16:_one_earth}. \citet{gordeev13:_verif_gumic_mhd} compared sythetic GUMICS runs with empirical formula of the magnetopsuse locations. \citet{facsko16:_one_earth} used OMNI solar wind data as input and got the same result as \citet{gordeev13:_verif_gumic_mhd} and this paper.

Surprisingly the neutral sheets are visible in both simulations and observations (Figure~\ref{fig:nsplot},~Table~\ref{tab:ns}). This experience is expectional because the night side magnetosphere of the GUMICS$-$4 simulations is small and twisted \citep{gordeev13:_verif_gumic_mhd,facsko16:_one_earth}. However, in this cases the IMF has no large $B_{y}$ component. From \citet{facsko16:_one_earth} we know that the GUMICS has normal long tail (or night side magnetosphere) if the $B_{y}$ is small.
