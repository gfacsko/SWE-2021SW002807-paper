We compare a model of the terrestrial cosmic environment with the magnetic field, solar wind velocity, furthermore two different density measurements of a space mission using 1-year long data series and numerical results. We select intervals in the main domains in the proximity of the Earth where these instruments provided good quality data and the model predicted well the region in which the spacecraft is located. We determine the location of the various separation layer of different domains from the spacecraft measurements and compare these locations to those predicted by the simulation. The model agrees well with the measurements in the solar wind however its accuracy is worse in the slower, thermalized, and compressed flow stream around the region dominated by the magnetic field of the Earth. In this region, the model does not seem to be realistic. The location of the separation layers is generally good however the boundary of the region dominated by the terrestrial magnetic field and the domain of the slower, thermalized, compressed solar wind stream is less accurate.
